Application.properties is configration file where we store data as key value pairs

DAL Layer(Data Access Layer) Code should be able to communicate with database
JDBC - java database connectivity APIs
mySQLDiver, H2Diver - These Drivers implement JDBC APIs

JDBC Apis -> Rules , JDBC drivers -> actual implementation

JPA -> Java persistent APIs
H2 - lightweight in memory database
